Lab demos for CSCI 3230U

# D3 and Ajax Branch

This demo shows how to create a basic bar graph using an array of dictionaries. The beginning of the code also shows how you can make an ajax call.

## Using Ajax
If you want to make an ajax call, be sure to start a python server in your working directory. You would also need to have Python installed.

1) Open a console in your working directory and type:

```
python -m http.server 8000
```
or if you're using Python 3:
```
python3 -m http.server 8000
``` 
You can use a different port if you like. After, go on your browser and type in "localhost:8000" to access your server and you should be able to see the files there. Click on your html file and you'll find your webpage
